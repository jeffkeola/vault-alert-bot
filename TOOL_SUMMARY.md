## 💎 Competitive Advantages Built In

### 1. Championship Frequency Analysis
Unlike basic rankings, this tool identifies **proven winners** - players who consistently appear on championship teams.

### 2. Situational Factor Integration  
The tool automatically identifies and values players in advantageous situations (new coaches, contract years, etc.)

### 3. League Format Optimization
Each league format gets customized recommendations, not one-size-fits-all advice.

### 4. Multi-Source Value Calculation
Combines Vegas lines, expert projections, and historical performance for comprehensive values.

### 5. Color-Coded Simplicity
Complex analytics distilled into simple visual cues:
- 🟢 Elite/Great (proven winners)
- 🟡 Good (solid picks)
- 🟠 Moderate (value plays)
- 🔴 Risky (proceed with caution)
