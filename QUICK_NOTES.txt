JWOvaultbot - Quick Reference

IMMEDIATE TODO:
- Add vault addresses back (lost during restart)
- Test first real confluence alert
- Monitor Render logs for errors
- Create GitHub backup release

BOT COMMANDS TO REMEMBER:
/start - Show welcome menu
/status - Check bot health  
/list_tracked - See tracked addresses
/add_vault ADDRESS NAME - Track new vault
/set_rule confluence 3 - Need 3 addresses for alert
/set_rule min_value 1000 - $1000 minimum trade
/start_monitoring - Begin tracking

CURRENT SETTINGS:
- Confluence: 2 addresses needed
- Time window: 300 seconds (5 minutes)  
- Min trade: $1000
- Check frequency: 30 seconds

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Bot not responding? Check Render dashboard
- Too many alerts? Increase min_value or confluence count
- Too few alerts? Decrease min_value or confluence count

GOALS THIS WEEK:
- Get first real confluence alert
- Verify bot stability
- Document which vault addresses work best
