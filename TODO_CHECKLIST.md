# ✅ JWOvaultbot - Quick To-Do Checklist

## 🔥 This Week's Priorities

### 🎯 Bot Testing & Validation:
- [ ] **Add 6 vault addresses** back to tracking (lost during restart)
- [ ] **Start monitoring** with `/start_monitoring` command
- [ ] **Wait for first real confluence alert** 📱
- [ ] **Verify alert looks good** in Telegram when it arrives
- [ ] **Test `/status` command** to monitor bot health

### 📊 Performance Monitoring:
- [ ] **Check Render logs** daily for any errors
- [ ] **Monitor API rate limiting** - watch for 429 errors
- [ ] **Track alert frequency** - how many per day/week?
- [ ] **Document any issues** that come up
- [ ] **Note which vault addresses work best**

### 🔧 Quick Improvements:
- [ ] **Create stable GitHub release** as backup
- [ ] **Test all bot commands** once more
- [ ] **Fine-tune rules** if needed:
  - [ ] Try confluence count of 3 instead of 2?
  - [ ] Adjust time window if too many/few alerts?
  - [ ] Change minimum trade value if needed?

## 🗓️ Daily Checklist

### Morning Routine:
- [ ] Check Telegram for overnight alerts
- [ ] Check Render logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify bot responds to `/status`

### Evening Routine:
- [ ] Review any alerts received today
- [ ] Check if vault list needs updates
- [ ] Plan any rule adjustments for tomorrow

## 🚨 If Things Go Wrong:

### Bot Not Responding:
1. [ ] Check Render dashboard - is service running?
2. [ ] Look at logs for error messages
3. [ ] Try restarting the service in Render
4. [ ] If still broken, revert to last working GitHub release

### Too Many Alerts:
1. [ ] Increase minimum trade value: `/set_rule min_value 2000`
2. [ ] Increase confluence requirement: `/set_rule confluence 3`
3. [ ] Reduce time window: `/set_rule time_window 180`

### Too Few Alerts:
1. [ ] Decrease minimum trade value: `/set_rule min_value 500`
2. [ ] Decrease confluence requirement: `/set_rule confluence 2`
3. [ ] Increase time window: `/set_rule time_window 600`

## 📝 Notes & Ideas

### Vault Addresses to Try:
- [ ] Research popular Hyperliquid vaults
- [ ] Find addresses from successful traders
- [ ] Look for vaults with consistent activity
- [ ] Start with 3-5 addresses, expand if working well

### Rule Experiments:
- [ ] Try different time windows (3min vs 5min vs 10min)
- [ ] Test different minimum values ($500 vs $1000 vs $2000)
- [ ] Experiment with confluence counts (2 vs 3 vs 4 addresses)

### Success Metrics:
- [ ] Track: How many alerts per week?
- [ ] Track: What percentage lead to profitable moves?
- [ ] Track: How fast do alerts arrive after trades?
- [ ] Goal: 2-5 high-quality alerts per week
